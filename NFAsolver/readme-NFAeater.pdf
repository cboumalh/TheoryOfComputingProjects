1) Team name: NFAeater
2) Members: Christopher Boumalhab
3) Time spent: Four and a half hours by myself
4) Code development was done locally. I will be uploading my code to github. Testing was using print statements and comparing results
to what they are supposed to be according to my calculations and the answers given in the assignment
5) Language and libraries used: Python3 with the sys and csv libraries
6) Main data structures used were lists, stacks, and dicts. A stack was used to implement the DFS, a list was used to track the current path
I am on in the tree, and a dict was used to store the transitions in the NFA.
7) The test cases I used were from the given csv files: N1.csv, N3.csv, and N4.csv. I used the strings 010110, 000, and bba respectively for each
NFA. They all provided outputs that seemed plausibe to me, and stored them in text files.
