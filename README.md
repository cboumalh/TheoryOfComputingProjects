The BruteSatSolver project is a python script that uses the brute force approach to solve SAT problems

The NFA solver is a python script that takes in a string input and an NFA in a csv file, and outputs the paths that lead to a final state

The Turing Machine script that takes in a text file and traces the paths and steps
