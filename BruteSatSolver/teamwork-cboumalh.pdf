Theory Project

1. Who were the other team members.
    -I did this on my own

2. Under whose netid is the readme-team.pdf, code, and other material saved.
    -cboumalh

3. How much time did you personally spend on the project, and what did you do?
    -around two days, and I coded all of the functionality

4. What did you personally learn from the project, both about the topic, above program-
ming and code development techniques, and about algorithms.
    -I learned about the limits of computational power for a computer, and how some languages
    are faster than others. The algorithms were pretty simple I'd say for the brute force
    solver. I learned that SAT solvers are an area of interest in general from doing some research,
    and it is not just something that we as a class are looking into.

5. In your own words, how did the team dynamics work? What could be improved? (e.g.
did you use github and if so did it help, did you meet frequently enough, etc.)
    -Working on it by myself made it pretty simple and I did not need to use github

6. From your own perspective, what was the role of each team member, and did any
member greatly exceed expectations (and if so how/why), or vice versa.
    -I worked on it by myself, so not sure how to answer that
